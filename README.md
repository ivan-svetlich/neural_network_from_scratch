# Neural Network from Scratch
The following code implements a simple neural network with depth = 1 (only one hidden layer). 
* The sigmoid function is used as activation function.
* Weights and biases are initialized with random values.
* The network adapts to any number of features and outputs, as long as [number of outputs] < [number of feautures]. 
* The number of nodes in the hidden layer is calculated as the average between [number of feautures]  and [number of outputs], rounded up.

The neural network is then used to predict people's genders based on weight and height.
